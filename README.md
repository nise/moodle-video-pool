## Videofile

moodle-video-pool is base on [Videofile](https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_videofile) by Jonas Nockert <jonasnockert@gmail.com>. It is a Moodle 3.5+ resource plugin intended to provide teacherswith easy handling of cross-browser compatible videos using Video.js
(http://videojs.com). In most cases it should be enough to add .mp4 video
files which will then play in an html5 player on most browsers and in a
flash player in older browsers.

Videofile and Video.js also supports WebVTT captions as well as a poster
image that displays before the video is started.
